                    <div class="Definitions">
                        The django-bootstrap3 app is a third-party package that integrates Bootstrap 3 with Django
                        projects.
                        It provides template tags and filters to easily include Bootstrap styles and components in
                        Django templates. <br>
                        This
                        app downloads the required Bootstrap files, places them in an appropriate
                        location in your project, and makes the styling directives available in your
                        project's templates.
                        To install django-bootstrap3, issue the following command in an active
                        virtual environment:
                    </div>

                        We need django-bootstrap3 to include jQuery. Add this code to the end of settings.py. <br>

                        correct location manually.

                        work together on projects from anywhere.
                        You must create an account using your university email address. This account will be used to
                        access the repositories created by your teacher and to submit your work. <br>
                        To create a GitHub account, you need to go to the official website: GitHub then click on the
                        "Sign up" button and follow the instructions.

                                    There are several ways to install Git on macOS. The easiest is probably to
                                    install
                                    the Xcode
                                    Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by
                                    trying to
                                    run git from
                                    the Terminal the very first time.
                                </p>

                                    If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary

                                    Git

                                    Untracked files are everything else — any files in your working directory that

                                    of your
                                    files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you
                                    haven't
                                    edited anything.

                            last
                            commit.
                            As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all those staged
                            changes,
                            and the cycle repeats.
